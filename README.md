- 👋 Hi, I’m @mtafiti
- 👀 I’m interested in any programming language (or even framework) that I deem interesting and worth checking out! Current favourites are TypeScript, Scala, Dart and some Solidity.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Dart and some Solidity.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on OSS libraries that have helped me with my day-to-day.
- 📫 How to reach me: link up on github, perhaps?
